    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine chicken, lime juice, and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Stir
          to make sure chicken is evenly covered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook chicken mixture over medium heat until firm, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, sour cream, and salsa in a bowl. Season
          with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put a few spoonfuls of the sour cream mixture in the bottom of a
          9x9-inch baking dish. Layer noodles and chicken on top. Cover with
          remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until noodles are tender and cheese is
          melted, about 1 hour.
